Generally speaking, `Db` aims to minimise the SQL Server boilerplate code. In addition, several methods target front-end needs of an ASP.NET website. Using methods such as `Json` or `Csv`, the SQL Server data will not be cast as POCO and will be directly available for JavaScript use, saving development and processing time.
